We present results of a systematic investigation aimed at understanding the role that starspots play in determining the internal structure and observable properties of young, low-mass stars. A parametrized two-temperature starspot model is used along with stellar evolution isochrones and theoretical bolometric corrections to infer properties of spotted stars.
