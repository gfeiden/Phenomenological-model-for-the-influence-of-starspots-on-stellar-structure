# Introduction

Low-mass stars possessing convective envelopes often exhibit characteristics and behavior that is consistent with the presence of brightness asymmetries at their photosphere. A well known example is a periodic sinusoidal brightness modulation observed in photometric lightcurves of a large number of stars (e.g., Lock- wood et al. 2007; Ciardi et al. 2011). In addition, spectroscopic evidence exists supporting the idea of stars possessing a distribution of temperatures at their surface, including variations of individual spectral line profiles (e.g., Barnes & Collier Cameron 2001), the shape of molecular band features (e.g., Oâ€™Neal et al. 1998), and shapes of broader spectral energy distributions (e.g., Stauffer et al. 2003). These brightness asymmetries are thought to be the result of localized spots, analogous to sunspots, that are either darker or brighter than the star's ambient photosphere. Despite the near ubiquity of brightness asymmetries among stars with convective envelopes, relatively few studies have investigated their influence on stellar structure and evolution (Spruit 1982a; Spruit & Weiss 1986; Jackson & Jeffries 2014; Somers & Pinsonneault 2015).
