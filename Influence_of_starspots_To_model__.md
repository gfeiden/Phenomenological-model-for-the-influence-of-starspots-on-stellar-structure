# Influence of starspots

To model the influence of starspots on stellar structure, we develop a simple parametrized model to apply corrections to stellar evolution model isochrones. The impact of starspots on stellar structure can be reduced to variations in five quantities: the bolometric luminosity ratio between a spotted star and an unspotted counterpart ($\zeta$), the ratio of the surface area between a spotted and a similar unspotted star ($\eta$), the fractional areal coverage of spots ($\rho$), the temperature ratio between a starâ€™s photospheric temperature and it's original effective temperature ($\varphi$), and the temperature ratio between the unspotted photosphere and the spots ($\varpi$). These are summarized in Table 1.
